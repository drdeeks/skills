# Weather Skill

Get current weather conditions and forecasts.

## When to Use

✅ **USE this skill when:**

- "What's the weather?"
- "Will it rain today/tomorrow?"
- "Temperature in [city]"
- "Weather forecast for the week"
- Travel planning weather checks

## When NOT to Use

❌ **DON'T use this skill when:**

- Historical weather data → use weather archives/APIs
- Climate analysis or trends → use specialized data sources
- Hyper-local microclimate data → use local sensors
- Severe weather alerts → check official NWS sources
- Aviation/marine weather → use specialized services (METAR, etc.)

## Location

Always include a city, region, or airport code in weather queries.

## Commands

### Current Weather

```bash
# One-line summary
curl "wttr.in/London?format=3"

# Detailed current conditions
curl "wttr.in/London?0"

# Specific city
curl "wttr.in/New+York?format=3"
```

### Forecasts

```bash
# 3-day forecast
curl "wttr.in/London"

# Week forecast
curl "wttr.in/London?format=v2"

# Specific day (0=today, 1=tomorrow, 2=day after)
curl "wttr.in/London?1"
```

### Format Options

```bash
# One-liner
curl "wttr.in/London?format=%l:+%c+%t+%w"

# JSON output
curl "wttr.in/London?format=j1"

# PNG image
curl "wttr.in/London.png"
```

### Format Codes

- `%c` — Weather condition emoji
- `%t` — Temperature
- `%f` — "Feels like"
- `%w` — Wind
- `%h` — Humidity
- `%p` — Precipitation
- `%l` — Location

## Quick Responses

**"What's the weather?"**

```bash
curl -s "wttr.in/London?format=%l:+%c+%t+(feels+like+%f),+%w+wind,+%h+humidity"
```

**"Will it rain?"**

```bash
curl -s "wttr.in/London?format=%l:+%c+%p"
```

**"Weekend forecast"**

```bash
curl "wttr.in/London?format=v2"
```


## Workflow

### Step 1: Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
```

### Step 2: Configuration

```bash
# Configure the skill
```

### Step 3: Usage

```bash
# Use the skill
python3 scripts/main.py
```

### Step 4: Validation

```bash
# Validate the skill
python3 scripts/validate.py
```


## Provider Compatibility

| Provider | Compatibility | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Claude (Anthropic) | Full | MCP servers, tool use |
| OpenAI / ChatGPT | Full | Function calling, Actions |
| Mistral / Le Chat | Full | Tool calling, script execution |
| Gemini (Google) | Full | Extensions, Vertex AI |
| Hermes (Nous) | Full | Tool-use fine-tuned |
| GitHub Copilot | Partial | Code generation; use external runner for scripts |
| Any LLM + tools | Full | Scripts are plain Python, provider-independent |


## Free-First Strategy

| Tier | Cost | Stack |
|------|------|-------|
| **Tier 0** | $0/mo | Python 3.8+ (all scripts use stdlib only) |
| **Tier 1** | $0-5/mo | + CI/CD for automated validation |
| **Tier 2** | $5-20/mo | + Hosted skill registry for team distribution |

The entire core toolchain is permanently $0.


## Enforced Output Statistics

Every script produces structured output on completion:

```json
{
  "operation": "script_name",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "status": "success | failed",
  "skill_name": "the-skill-name",
  "details": {},
  "cost": {"tier": 0, "amount_usd": 0.0, "service": "local"}
}
```


## Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Invalid input | Validate and report with guidance |
| Missing dependency | Auto-install or report requirement |
| Network failure | Retry with exponential backoff |
| Permission denied | Report and suggest alternatives |
| Resource not found | Report with available options |


## Enhancement Hooks

| Skill | Enhancement | When to Add |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `skill-creator` | Basic skill creation | When creating simple skills |
| `skill-creator-pro` | Enterprise upgrade | When upgrading to enterprise |
| `html-report` | Visual validation dashboard | When auditing many skills |
| `xlsx` | Export validation results | When tracking skill quality metrics |


## Scripts Reference

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `scripts/validate.py` | weather script | Run with python3 |
| `scripts/main.py` | weather script | Run with python3 |
