# Polymarket — Prediction Market Data

Query prediction market data from Polymarket using their public REST APIs.
All endpoints are read-only and require zero authentication.

See `references/api-endpoints.md` for the full endpoint reference with curl examples.

## When to Use

- User asks about prediction markets, betting odds, or event probabilities
- User wants to know "what are the odds of X happening?"
- User asks about Polymarket specifically
- User wants market prices, orderbook data, or price history
- User asks to monitor or track prediction market movements

## Key Concepts

- **Events** contain one or more **Markets** (1:many relationship)
- **Markets** are binary outcomes with Yes/No prices between 0.00 and 1.00
- Prices ARE probabilities: price 0.65 means the market thinks 65% likely
- `outcomePrices` field: JSON-encoded array like `["0.80", "0.20"]`
- `clobTokenIds` field: JSON-encoded array of two token IDs [Yes, No] for price/book queries
- `conditionId` field: hex string used for price history queries
- Volume is in USDC (US dollars)

## Three Public APIs

1. **Gamma API** at `gamma-api.polymarket.com` — Discovery, search, browsing
2. **CLOB API** at `clob.polymarket.com` — Real-time prices, orderbooks, history
3. **Data API** at `data-api.polymarket.com` — Trades, open interest

## Typical Workflow

When a user asks about prediction market odds:

1. **Search** using the Gamma API public-search endpoint with their query
2. **Parse** the response — extract events and their nested markets
3. **Present** market question, current prices as percentages, and volume
4. **Deep dive** if asked — use clobTokenIds for orderbook, conditionId for history

## Presenting Results

Format prices as percentages for readability:
- outcomePrices `["0.652", "0.348"]` becomes "Yes: 65.2%, No: 34.8%"
- Always show the market question and probability
- Include volume when available

Example: `"Will X happen?" — 65.2% Yes ($1.2M volume)`

## Parsing Double-Encoded Fields

The Gamma API returns `outcomePrices`, `outcomes`, and `clobTokenIds` as JSON strings
inside JSON responses (double-encoded). When processing with Python, parse them with
`json.loads(market['outcomePrices'])` to get the actual array.

## Rate Limits

Generous — unlikely to hit for normal usage:
- Gamma: 4,000 requests per 10 seconds (general)
- CLOB: 9,000 requests per 10 seconds (general)
- Data: 1,000 requests per 10 seconds (general)


## Provider Compatibility

| Provider | Compatibility | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Claude (Anthropic) | Full | MCP servers, tool use |
| OpenAI / ChatGPT | Full | Function calling, Actions |
| Mistral / Le Chat | Full | Tool calling, script execution |
| Gemini (Google) | Full | Extensions, Vertex AI |
| Hermes (Nous) | Full | Tool-use fine-tuned |
| GitHub Copilot | Partial | Code generation; use external runner for scripts |
| Any LLM + tools | Full | Scripts are plain Python, provider-independent |


## Free-First Strategy

| Tier | Cost | Stack |
|------|------|-------|
| **Tier 0** | $0/mo | Python 3.8+ (all scripts use stdlib only) |
| **Tier 1** | $0-5/mo | + CI/CD for automated validation |
| **Tier 2** | $5-20/mo | + Hosted skill registry for team distribution |

The entire core toolchain is permanently $0.


## Enforced Output Statistics

Every script produces structured output on completion:

```json
{
  "operation": "script_name",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "status": "success | failed",
  "skill_name": "the-skill-name",
  "details": {},
  "cost": {"tier": 0, "amount_usd": 0.0, "service": "local"}
}
```


## Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Invalid input | Validate and report with guidance |
| Missing dependency | Auto-install or report requirement |
| Network failure | Retry with exponential backoff |
| Permission denied | Report and suggest alternatives |
| Resource not found | Report with available options |


## Enhancement Hooks

| Skill | Enhancement | When to Add |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `skill-creator` | Basic skill creation | When creating simple skills |
| `skill-creator-pro` | Enterprise upgrade | When upgrading to enterprise |
| `html-report` | Visual validation dashboard | When auditing many skills |
| `xlsx` | Export validation results | When tracking skill quality metrics |


## Scripts Reference

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `scripts/polymarket.py` | polymarket script | Run with python3 |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
```

### Step 2: Configuration

```bash
# Configure the skill
```

### Step 3: Usage

```bash
# Use the skill
python3 scripts/main.py
```

### Step 4: Validation

```bash
# Validate the skill
python3 scripts/validate.py
```

## Limitations

- This skill is read-only — it does not support placing trades
- Trading requires wallet-based crypto authentication (EIP-712 signatures)
- Some new markets may have empty price history
- Geographic restrictions apply to trading but read-only data is globally accessible
